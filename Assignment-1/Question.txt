1)
Bob wants to send an encrypted message to Alice. To share the key Alice encrypts the key for Vigenere Cipher using a row transposition
cipher and sends to Bob the secure key for the row transposition cipher through a secure channel. Bob encrypts his message using 
Vigenere cipher with the key he decrypts from the row transposition cipher. Find out what is the ecrypted message Bob finally sends to 
Alice.

Input:
First line of the input contains l, the length of the key of the row transposition cipher.

The next line contains the l elements of the key of the row transposition cipher.

The next line contains a string encypted_key which is the key of the Vigenere Cipher encrypted with the row transposition cipher.
(Assume length of the encrypted key is a multiple of the key length given above.)

The last line contains a string plaintext which is the message Bob wants to encrypt. (Assume the message contains no spaces)

Output:
In the first line output the key of the Vigenere Cipher.
In the second line print the ciphertext produced using the above key.
Constraints
≤l≤100000
≤len(encrypted_key)≤100000
≤len(plaintext)≤100000
The Vigenere cipher is used with repeated key
Assume the numbering of alphabets as (a-0, b-1, .., z-25).
All string are in lowercase alphabets and don't conatin spaces.

Sample Input:
7
4 3 1 2 5 6 7
ttnaaptmtsuoaodwcoixknlypetz
encryptthistextandsendittoalice

Sample Output:
attackpostponeduntiltwoamxyz
egvrazihzbhhrbwuawapgzwtflykivx

EXPLANATION:
The ciphertext ttnaaptmtsuoaodwcoixknlypetz when decrypted with the key 4 3 1 2 5 6 7 using row transposition cipher gives the plaintext
as attackpostponeduntiltwoamxyz. The plaintext attackpostponeduntiltwoamxyz is the key for the vigenere cipher with repeated key, the 
message encryptthistextandsendittoalice is encrypted as egvrazihzbhhrbwuawapgzwtflykivx.

2)
Batman sent Commisioner Gordon a message encrypted with the Hill Cipher containing the location of the next strike by the joker. 
The message is encrypted with Hill Cipher and the key size is 2. The message also contains how the 2 most commonly occouring digrams of 
the english language ("TH","HE") are encrypted. The message is in uppercase with letters A-Z. White spaces are removed and in case of an
incomplete digram Z is added. You need to help Commisioner Gordon decrypt the message, to help prevent the attack.

Input:
First line will contain a string which is the ciphertext.

The next line contains the encrypted digrams (corresponding to "TH" and "HE") respectively separated by a space.

Output:
Output the decrypted text(you don't have to remove filler 'Z' characters).

Constraints:
1≤sizeofencryptedtext≤100000

Sample Input:
ALYHAUKCRT
RI JT

Sample Output:
ARKHAMCITY

3)
Given a plaintext and key for DES encryption, output the 16 keys used in the encryption process. Also output the result of the first 
fiestel round (i.e. L1R1).

The permutation tables and substitution boxes to be used can be found here.

Take the number of left shfts (1 or 2) for generating the 16 keys as explained in the book.

Input:
First line contains the plaintext.

The second line has the key.

Output:
The first 16 lines contain the keys. The next line has the output of one round of encryption.

Constraints:
64bit plaintext and key.

Sample Input:
0123456789ABCDEF
